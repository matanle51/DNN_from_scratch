# Deep Neural Network implementation from scratch in Python
This repository provides code building all relevant components necessary to train a deep neural network.

Training is done by the trainer.py:
```
python trainer.py
```

To validate the gradient calculation:
```
python grad_test.py
```

To validate the Jacobian calculation:
```
python grad_test.py
```

To validate the Gradient calculation throughout the entire network:
```
python test_full_nn_grad.py
```
